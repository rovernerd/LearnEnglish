## 如何更礼貌的讲英文

### 五个诀窍

- 用I代替You开头

  Your room is a mess => I think your room is a mess

- 使用正面的词汇

   I think your room is a mess => I think your room is not very well organized

- 用问句代替祈使句(使用原形动词做开头的句子)

  Go clean your room => Can you clean your room?

- 使用过去式

  Can you go chean your room? => could you go clean your room?

- 句子加上please

  Could you go clean your room? => Could you go clean your room, please?

### 常见不礼貌说法

#### 点餐

I want this/that => Could i have this?

#### 询问问题

Whats your problem?(带有侵略性,你有问题吧？) =>  whats wrong?
